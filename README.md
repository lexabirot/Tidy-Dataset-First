# Tidy-Dataset-First
For the purpose of Getting and Cleaning Data Course Assignment

This is a study about human activity recognition using smartphones. Various measurements have been made on several features.
Here I Alex DZUKAM, provide two Datasets:
- X_df that is tidy and show in each row: the subject being tested, the activity they was doing and the mean and standard deviation of all the measurements collected on each feature.
- averageX_df that summarise the first one, providing for each subject and each activity the average of all the variables. That is to say we have the average of the mean and the average of the standard deviation measured on all the features tested in the case of this study
